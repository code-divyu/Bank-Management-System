Bank Management System
A comprehensive Bank Management System project for managing banking operations. Built in Java as a beginner-friendly project to help you master core banking functionality and file handling concepts.

Overview
This project simulates a basic banking environment, enabling users to create and manage accounts through a command-line interface. Useful for learning how to design object-oriented systems, handle file storage, and implement user interaction in Java.

Features
Account Creation: Set up new bank accounts with essential user information.

View Account Details: Retrieve and display detailed information of individual accounts.

Deposit Funds: Add money to any active account.

Withdraw Funds: Remove money from accounts, with balance checks to prevent overdrafts.

Delete Accounts: Remove bank accounts from the system.

File Persistence: All account data is stored in text files for persistence across restarts.
